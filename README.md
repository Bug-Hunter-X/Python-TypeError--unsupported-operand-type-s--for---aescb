# Python TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /

This example demonstrates a common Python error: `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /`. This occurs when attempting arithmetic operations (like division) with incompatible data types, such as an integer and a string. The `bug.py` file contains code exhibiting this error. `bugSolution.py` presents solutions that implement comprehensive error checking and type validation to mitigate such issues.  The solutions include type hints and try-except blocks for graceful handling of diverse input types.
